The rise of Big Data is shown in terms of its growth and significance. A prediction is made that the paradigm which has held ‘til now of individual researchers with personal computers will give way to communities of researchers organizing through clouds. A more in-depth look at Unit 1 follows, focusing on the chapters from Distributed and Cloud Computing: From Parallel Processing to the Internet of Things.</p>",
1,Cloud Computing Fundamentals,3,Data Center Model,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson1.3/Lesson1.3Howsearchworks_Text_.html,6Hq_LuLB-RU,"<p>A look at what truly defines a ‘cloud’. Advantages like scalability and cost-effectiveness have promulgated commercial cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2. Cloud architecture as divided into three layers: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. AzureBlast is used as an example of how to utilize the cloud setup. Certain misconceptions about clouds are then presented for further discussion.</p>",

In response to this, the way we conduct scientific research has also undergone an upgrade. However, the average scientist would rather focus on their own research rather than spend time trying to learn different methods of cloud and supercomputing.</p>",

1,Cloud Computing Fundamentals,6,"Challenges",,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson1.4/Lesson1.4Theartofkeywordchoice_Text_.html,zfwtsVmeKLg,"<p>The demands of Big Data calls for advances in areas like distributed computing, systems management, internet technology, and hardware. Clouds have become more prominent in the last few decades, so much so that many people today take advantage of them without even knowing it. Of course, this has also led to increased concerns about security, price, tech support, etc. In spite of this, clouds still have clear advantages over traditional computing models. A quiz is offered at the end asking students to correctly place software in a hierarchy of computing.</p>",

3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),1,Apache Data Analysis Open Stack,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.1/Lesson3.1Weborganization_Text_.html,jrINOPhfPXY,"<p>The buildup of Big Data has seen the development of new data storage systems like MapReduce and Hadoop. Apache’s Big Data Stack houses a host of programs designed around Google's offerings like MapReduce.  The architecture of Hadoop 1.0 and 2.0 are compared, along with an examination of the MapReduce concept. A demo video of Twister-MDS includes a 3-dimensional representation of data cluster sorting through the PlotViz program. Data analysis tool Twister boasts features like in-memory support of tasks, data flow separation, and portability.</p>",

Storage is done in the Hadoop Distributed File System through master and slave nodes. Compute is handled by JobTracker and TaskTracker; the duties of these two intertwined programs are then explored more fully.</p>",

This process starts with Hadoop Distributed File System, which handles the input data. Key value pairs are assigned to the data blocks.  Combiner reduces data size and Partitioner determines distribution of keys among reducers. Intermediate data is stored in a circular buffer before being sent to reduce tasks. Shuffle and Merge are used to order and reduce size of intermediate data. Reduce tasks take over then to determine the output data format. A final chart illustrates the concept of parallelism in MapReduce.</p>",

The master node pings worker nodes regularly to verify they are working, and acts accordingly if they do not respond. A diagram illustrates the files which are in charge of things like number of map and reduce tasks, and what to do when the limit is reached on the buffer. The lecture ends with a discussion of class assignments.</p>",

The basic bioinformatics BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Sequence Tool) program data flow is illustrated. An example of database creation comes from the Seattle Children’s Hospital. BLAST uses scores to find similar sequences in databases. </p>",

Point-to-point (P2P) communication in MPI is used as an example of parallelization. Each successive process adds its own stamp to the data before passing it on to the next. Matrix multiplication for scientific applications differs from the norm in that data is sent in a matrix, not a string. WordCount functions in a map/reduce pattern. These are all types of SIMD. SPMD and MPMD are two other types of model.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),12,"Data Locality",,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.5/Lesson3.5IntextandAdvancedSearch_Text_.html,RqLA7_asK50,"<p>A brief review is given of previous topics. As opposed to MPI and HPC, MapReduce brings the computation to the data, rather than vice-versa. This is done to limit energy usage and network congestion. Several factors such as number of nodes and tasks can impact data locality.  An equation to improve data locality is tested in an experiment, whose results are given. By default, Hadoop determines scheduling of tasks to available slots in terms of best local composition, not global.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),13,"Optimal Data Locality",,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.5/Lesson3.5IntextandAdvancedSearch_Text_.html,p8aI7CkC9Qw,"<p>Global data optimization can be achieved through a proposed algorithm given here. Task, slot, and cost are factors in this algorithm. Network bandwidth must also be taken into consideration when assigning tasks to slots. Linear Sum Assignment Problems require greater time to finish when matrix size is increased.  Two different scheduling algorithms were designed to improve the original one in Hadoop. An experiment was run comparing all three, with the network topology-aware algorithm clearly outperforming the others.</p>",

Using Bag of Divisible Tasks method, tasks can be split into sub-tasks and distributed amongst slots to maximize efficiency.  When splitting tasks, one must take into account when and which tasks to split, as well as how and how many. In our current proposed algorithm, tasks are split until each slot is occupied. It also uses ASPK (Aggressive Scheduling with Prior Knowledge) to split larger tasks first and when the performance gain is deemed optimal. Optimal and Expected Remaining Job Execution Time can help determine task splitting. Several examples are offered with either single or multiple jobs.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),15,"Resource Utilization and Speculative Execution",,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.5/Lesson3.5IntextandAdvancedSearch_Text_.html,wWyFiqDIYus,"<p>Resource stealing involves appropriating cores that are kept in reserve on separate nodes and returning them when the computation is over. Speculative execution addresses fault tolerance; when the master node notices a task is running slowly, it will start a speculative task which can take over if it is determined the original task will not finish in time. Overuse of speculative tasks can lead to poor data locality and higher energy demands.</p>",
