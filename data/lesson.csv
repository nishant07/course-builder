1,Cloud Computing Fundamentals,2,Introduction,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson1.2/Lesson1.2Filteringbycolor_Text_.html,5lKj8_nqj9k,"<p>Changes in computing technology for the past five decades are discussed. The rise of Big Data is shown in terms of its growth and significance. A prediction is made that the paradigm which has held ‘til now of individual researchers with personal computers will give way to communities of researchers organizing through clouds. A more in-depth look at Unit 1 follows, focusing on the chapters from Distributed and Cloud Computing: From Parallel Processing to the Internet of Things.</p>",
1,Cloud Computing Fundamentals,3,Data Center Model,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson1.3/Lesson1.3Howsearchworks_Text_.html,6Hq_LuLB-RU,"<p>A look at what truly defines a ‘cloud’. Advantages like scalability and cost-effectiveness have promulgated commercial cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2. Cloud architecture as divided into three layers: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. AzureBlast is used as an example of how to utilize the cloud setup. Certain misconceptions about clouds are then presented for further discussion.</p>",

In response to this, the way we conduct scientific research has also undergone an upgrade. However, the average scientist would rather focus on their own research rather than spend time trying to learn different methods of cloud and supercomputing.</p>",

A chart is shown illustrating how use of clouds trades cost and control for efficiency. Following this is an exploration of the MapReduce program, and an illustration of its concepts through WordCount. Finally, four distinct approaches to MapReduce are compared.</p>",
1,Cloud Computing Fundamentals,6,"Challenges",,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson1.4/Lesson1.4Theartofkeywordchoice_Text_.html,zfwtsVmeKLg,"<p>The demands of Big Data calls for advances in areas like distributed computing, systems management, internet technology, and hardware. Clouds have become more prominent in the last few decades, so much so that many people today take advantage of them without even knowing it. Of course, this has also led to increased concerns about security, price, tech support, etc. In spite of this, clouds still have clear advantages over traditional computing models. A quiz is offered at the end asking students to correctly place software in a hierarchy of computing.</p>",

Computational models must be designed with the problems and effective resources in mind. A demonstration of cloud use for Bioinformatics on the FutureGrid educational testbed shows how clouds offer advantages of provisioning and virtual cluster support. Overhead and performance issues are touched upon through charts showing the use of three different virtual clusters.</p>",

Other topics cover MapReduce in Single Program Multiple Data mode, genetic algorithms in MapReduce, Hadoop supporting recommender systems, K-means clustering, etc. Following this the benefits/vulnerabilities of clouds and some of their most well-known programs are showcased in other research assignments. In conclusion, we have a list of the requirements for current student project submissions.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),1,Apache Data Analysis Open Stack,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.1/Lesson3.1Weborganization_Text_.html,jrINOPhfPXY,"<p>The buildup of Big Data has seen the development of new data storage systems like MapReduce and Hadoop. Apache’s Big Data Stack houses a host of programs designed around Google's offerings like MapReduce.  The architecture of Hadoop 1.0 and 2.0 are compared, along with an examination of the MapReduce concept. A demo video of Twister-MDS includes a 3-dimensional representation of data cluster sorting through the PlotViz program. Data analysis tool Twister boasts features like in-memory support of tasks, data flow separation, and portability.</p>",

A breakdown of basic MapReduce terms and functions follows. Use of MapReduce has flourished since its premier, as illustrated by an in-depth example of its use in WordCount. Finally the basic process of MapReduce is shown. </p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),3,Hadoop Framework,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.3/Lesson3.3Removinginvasiveresults_Text_.html,Vuroqly6FTE,"<p>Hadoop is an open source version of MapReduce designed for broad application in terms of code and settings. Storage is done in the Hadoop Distributed File System through master and slave nodes. Compute is handled by JobTracker and TaskTracker; the duties of these two intertwined programs are then explored more fully.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),4,Hadoop Tasks,,,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.4/Lesson3.4ORandquotes_Text_.html,UN4t3tvdjms,"<p>The Map stage of MapReduce is shown in greater detail. This process starts with Hadoop Distributed File System, which handles the input data. Key value pairs are assigned to the data blocks.  Combiner reduces data size and Partitioner determines distribution of keys among reducers. Intermediate data is stored in a circular buffer before being sent to reduce tasks. Shuffle and Merge are used to order and reduce size of intermediate data. Reduce tasks take over then to determine the output data format. A final chart illustrates the concept of parallelism in MapReduce.</p>",
3,How to Run MapReduce (PaaS),5,Fault Tolerance,yes,Lesson 3.5 Activity,//www.google.com/edu/coursebuilder/courses/pswg/1.2/assets/notes/Lesson3.5/Lesson3.5IntextandAdvancedSearch_Text_.html,a3AlOTmD42k,"<p>Fault tolerance is a natural benefit of MapReduce. The master node pings worker nodes regularly to verify they are working, and acts accordingly if they do not respond. A diagram illustrates the files which are in charge of things like number of map and reduce tasks, and what to do when the limit is reached on the buffer. The lecture ends with a discussion of class assignments.</p>",
