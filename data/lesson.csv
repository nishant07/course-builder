This process starts with Hadoop Distributed File System, which handles the input data. Key value pairs are assigned to the data blocks.  Combiner reduces data size and Partitioner determines distribution of keys among reducers. Intermediate data is stored in a circular buffer before being sent to reduce tasks.

As opposed to MPI and HPC, MapReduce brings the computation to the data, rather than vice-versa. This is done to limit energy usage and network congestion. Several factors such as number of nodes and tasks can impact data locality.  An equation to improve data locality is tested in an experiment, whose results are given. By default, Hadoop determines scheduling of tasks to available slots in terms of best local composition, not global.</p>",

Using Bag of Divisible Tasks method, tasks can be split into sub-tasks and distributed amongst slots to maximize efficiency.  When splitting tasks, one must take into account when and which tasks to split, as well as how and how many. In our current proposed algorithm, tasks are split until each slot is occupied. It also uses ASPK (Aggressive Scheduling with Prior Knowledge) to split larger tasks first and when the performance gain is deemed optimal. Optimal and Expected Remaining Job Execution Time can help determine task splitting. Several examples are offered with either single or multiple jobs.</p>",

Speculative execution addresses fault tolerance; when the master node notices a task is running slowly, it will start a speculative task which can take over if it is determined the original task will not finish in time. Overuse of speculative tasks can lead to poor data locality and higher energy demands.</p>",
